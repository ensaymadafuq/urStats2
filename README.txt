UrStats — Track. Reflect. Grow.

UrStats is a lightweight, static web application for University of Rizal System Students
to log and review their daily school activites(e.g Quizzes, Lectures, Exams, Extracculiculars, etc.)
and evaluate their performace through a journaling-type review. 
The website also allows students to connect, share insights, and engage with one another’s posts.

Many students struggle with academic burnout throughout the year. UrStats addresses this by providing a 
social platform for students to encourage students to participate more in (school related activities) by
providing achievments, statistics, and social connection.
UrStats helps students stay motivated, balanced, and connected throughout their academic journey.

UrStats also implements a School Year-End "Wrapped" - a personalized recap of each student’s university life 
throughout the year. This feature highlights academic milestones, activity summaries, and personal growth, 
allowing students to reflect on their progress and celebrate their achievements.
